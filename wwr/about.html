            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Established in 1992, Friends & Family Rafting began as a family weekend hobby.
                As our group was growing, we decided to make it official and make it a family business.
                Our main focus is to share our adventures with local families and friends, so they can also feel the joy and exitment these adventures provide.
                Now, our goal is to expand and welcome everyone, because rafting it's not only a sport or hobby. It becomes part of your life.
            All we care about is to provide an unforgetable experience, were everyone is welcome and become a part of our family.
